# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.
I'm sort of new to programming. I took three years of Computer Science in College. I have used Java, C++, Mips, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript before, but not avidly. I graduated on May 10th with a degree Interdisciplinary Studies in Computer Science.
